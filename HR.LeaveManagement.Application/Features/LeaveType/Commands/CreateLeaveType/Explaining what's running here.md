Great question Badri 👏👏! You're implementing a **CQRS Get Query** the **right way**, and you're almost there! Let me explain each step **in super simple language**, step by step like a story 🧒:

---

### 🧱 Step 1: The DTO (Data Transfer Object)

#### ✅ What you did:

You created something like:

```csharp
public class LeaveAllocationDto
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string LeaveTypeName { get; set; }
    public int NumberOfDays { get; set; }
}
```

#### 🤔 Why this is important:

Imagine you’re packing a gift 📦. The DTO is the **box** that contains exactly what data you want to send **outside** your app (like to the front-end or API).

You **don’t want to return full database objects**, because:

* They have sensitive data (e.g., passwords or IDs).
* They may have extra info that UI doesn't care about.
* You keep things **clean and fast**.

So, **DTO is like a clean shirt**, made ready to go out and meet people 😄.

---

### 🧾 Step 2: The Query Class

#### ✅ What you did:

```csharp
public class GetLeaveAllocationsQuery : IRequest<List<LeaveAllocationDto>>
{
}
```

#### 🤔 Why this is important:

This is like writing a **note or request form** that says:

> “Hey system! I want a list of Leave Allocations!”

This class tells MediatR:

* What you want (a list of LeaveAllocationDto).
* What type of request it is (a **query**, not a command).
* It’s like saying "Please get me some data" 📨

---

### 🧠 Step 3: The Handler

#### ✅ What you did:

```csharp
public class GetLeaveAllocationsQueryHandler : IRequestHandler<GetLeaveAllocationsQuery, List<LeaveAllocationDto>>
{
    public async Task<List<LeaveAllocationDto>> Handle(GetLeaveAllocationsQuery request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        // Logic to fetch data from DB, map to DTO and return
    }
}
```

#### 🤔 Why this is important:

This is the **person who reads the request note** and says, “Ah! You want leave allocations? Let me get them for you.” 🤓

The Handler:

* Talks to the database (through repositories).
* Fetches the correct data.
* Maps it to your DTO using AutoMapper or manual mapping.
* Sends the response back.

So think of this like the **worker who processes the request** and brings the gift 🎁.

### 🔁 In Summary:

| Step | Thing       | Role               | Simple Analogy                |
| ---- | ----------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| 1️⃣  | DTO         | Output format      | Clean gift box 📦             |
| 2️⃣  | Query class | Request definition | Request note 📝               |
| 3️⃣  | Handler     | Logic processor    | Person who does the job 🧑‍🔧 |

---

### 💡 Extra Tips:

* If you want to add filters (like get allocations for 1 user), you can add properties in the `GetLeaveAllocationsQuery`.
* Always test it using Swagger or Postman to make sure it returns the correct data.


Great question, Badri! 🌟

Let’s explain it like a simple story again:

---

### 🧠 You Asked:

> "What is returned back? The handler or the query?"

### ✅ The Answer:

**The result is returned by the *handler*** — **not** the query.

---

### 🧾 What Really Happens

When you call something like this in your controller:

```csharp
var allocations = await _mediator.Send(new GetLeaveAllocationsQuery());
```

Here's what happens step by step:

1. 📨 **You send the query** — `new GetLeaveAllocationsQuery()`

   * This is just a **message** or a **request note**.

2. 🔍 **MediatR looks around** and says:

   * “Who can handle a `GetLeaveAllocationsQuery`?”

3. 🙋 **Your handler** (`GetLeaveAllocationsQueryHandler`) says:

   * “That’s me! I can handle this!”

4. ⚙️ The **handler runs** its logic (e.g., talk to database, map to DTOs).

5. 🎁 The **handler returns the result**:

   * Like: `List<LeaveAllocationDto>`

6. 📦 This result is **given back to the controller**, and the controller sends it to the user/UI.

---

### 🧠 Easy Rule to Remember:

| Role          | What it does                                              |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ **Query**   | Just a message (a request)                                |
| ✅ **Handler** | The logic that handles the message and returns the result |

---

Let me show you like a full example:

```csharp
// In controller
public async Task<IActionResult> GetAllocations()
{
    var result = await _mediator.Send(new GetLeaveAllocationsQuery());
    return Ok(result); // 🎯 This is what comes from the handler
}
```

So the **return value comes from the handler**, not the query.
